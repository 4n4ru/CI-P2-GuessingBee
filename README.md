## Project Goals 
Guessing bee is a clasic Hangman game with a twist. Instead of hanging the clasic stickfigure, it's time to rescue some flowers so the bees can be happy!

### User Goals
- Play a fun and engaging word guessing game
- Test your general knowledge by guessing different phrases 

### Site Owner Goals
- Creating a fun and engaging game that users will want to play again and again.
- The game should be fully responsive to be able to be played on different devices.

## User Experience

### Target Audience
- casual gamers
- people who like word games
- people looking for a quick and easy yet engaging game 

### User Requrements and Expectations

### User Stories
1. As a user, I want to be able to pick a difficulty for the game
2. As a user, I want to test my general knowledge by guessing different phrases
3. As a user, I want to to be able to pick the letters both by clicking the mouse and by using the keyboard
4. As a user, I want to know what the correct phrase was in case I don't guess it correctly
5. As a user, I want feedback on my correct answers
6. As a site owner, I want for the user to be able to share the game with friends
7. As a site owner, I want for users to be able to make suggestions for new phrases.
8. As a site owner, I want users to have the option to play the game on multiple different devices. 

## Design

### Design Choices
The game was designed to have a calming and relaxing effect on the user. Instead of the classic stickfigure being hanged, the game uses flowers that lose petals. By doing so the negative connotation of the game being morbid or offensive is removed.

### Colour

### Fonts
For the fonts, Bootstrap's Native font stack was used. The phrase that is to be guessed monospace is used to avoid the words jumping form one line to the next and back depending on the guessed letter.
